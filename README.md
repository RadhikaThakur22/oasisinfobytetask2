The Unemployment Rate Prediction project is a machine learning-based approach to analyse and forecast unemployment trends over time. Using historical unemployment data containing attributes such as region, date, and unemployment rate, the project aims to identify patterns, understand economic fluctuations, and make accurate predictions for future unemployment levels. Data preprocessing and cleaning were performed using Pandas and NumPy to handle missing values, convert date formats, and prepare the dataset for modelling. Visual exploration was conducted using Matplotlib and Seaborn, generating insightful plots such as time series graphs, heatmaps, and trend lines to understand the data distribution and seasonal variations better.

The predictive modelling was implemented using Scikit-learn, experimenting with algorithms such as Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, and XGBoost to determine the best-performing model. Model performance was evaluated using metrics like RÂ² score, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), with the final model delivering highly reliable forecasts. This project demonstrates the application of supervised machine learning for economic analysis and serves as a valuable tool for policymakers, researchers, and analysts aiming to monitor and predict labour market conditions effectively.
